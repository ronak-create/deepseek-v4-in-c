/* dsv4_portable_io.h - shims for the Linux-only I/O calls the readers use.
 *
 * The engine asks for two things Linux gives it and Darwin does not spell the same way:
 *
 *   O_DIRECT       bypass the page cache on the trunk and expert reads. Darwin's
 *                  equivalent is not an open() flag but fcntl(F_NOCACHE) after the
 *                  fact, so O_DIRECT is defined to 0 here (open() is unaffected) and
 *                  dsv4_set_direct() applies the real thing to the returned descriptor.
 *
 *   posix_fadvise  a page-cache prefetch hint with no Darwin equivalent. Callers
 *                  already treat it as advisory -- the one call site returns early on
 *                  the direct path because the hint has nothing to populate there -- so
 *                  the shim is a no-op that keeps the buffered path compiling.
 *
 * Both call sites fall back to buffered reads when the direct path is unavailable, so
 * neither shim changes what the engine computes, only how fast it reads.
